# ProMotion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clearsightstudio/ProMotion.png)](https://travis-ci.org/clearsightstudio/ProMotion) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/clearsightstudio/ProMotion.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/clearsightstudio/ProMotion)

## A new way to easily build RubyMotion apps.

ProMotion is a RubyMotion gem that makes iOS development more like Ruby and less like Objective-C.
It introduces a clean, Ruby-style syntax for building screens that is easy to learn and remember and
abstracts a ton of boilerplate UIViewController, UINavigationController, and other iOS code into a
simple, Ruby-like DSL.

```ruby
class AppDelegate < PM::Delegate
  def on_load(app, options)
    open RootScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  end
end

class RootScreen < PM::Screen
  title "Root Screen"
  
  def push_new_screen
    open NewScreen
  end
end

class NewScreen < PM::TableScreen
  title "Table Screen"
  
  def table_data
    [{
      cells: [
        { title: "About this app", action: :tapped_about },
        { title: "Log out", action: :log_out }
      ]
    }]
  end
end
```

# Getting Started

Check out our new [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide) in the wiki!

# What's New?

## Version 1.0

* **New Screen** [`PM::MapScreen`](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::MapScreen)
* **New Screen** [`PM::WebScreen`](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::WebScreen)
* Added [`indexable`](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::TableScreen#indexable) as a `PM::TableScreen` feature
* Added `PM::SplitViewController` and the ability to open a screen `in_detail:` or `in_master:`. [More info here.](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Screen#openscreen-args--)
* Added `PM::TabBarController` and `PM::Tabs` and refactored the `open_tab_bar` code
* **IMPORTANT:** Changed `on_load` to fire more consistently. You are now encouraged to put your view setup code in here rather than `will_appear`.
* Many methods that used to require long UIKit constants now take short :symbols. Check documentation.
* Simpler `PM::Delegate` code, added `will_load(app, options)` and others. [See the documentation.](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Delegate)
* [Added a few keys and improvements](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/Reference%3A-All-available-table_data-options) to table_data
* Removed `PM::SectionedTableScreen` (`PM::TableScreen` is already a sectioned table)
* Removed any last UIKit monkeypatching. Everything is a subclass now. ProMotion is probably the least invasive RubyMotion gem in common use.
* Push Notification updates
* Renamed `PM::ViewHelper` to `PM::Styling` and [added some common helpers](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Screen#hex_colorstr)
* Added `will_present`, `on_present`, `will_dismiss`, `on_dismiss` to screens
* Major internal refactors everywhere
* Lots of new unit & functional tests
* Removed deprecations, cleaned up a lot of code
* Huge improvements to the [wiki](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki)

# Tutorials

## Sample Apps

Here's a demo app that is used to test new functionality. You might have to change the Gemfile
source to pull from Github.

# API Reference

We've created a comprehensive and always updated wiki with code examples, usage examples, and API reference.

### [ProMotion API Reference](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki)

# Help

If you need help, feel free to ping me on twitter [@jamonholmgren](http://twitter.com/jamonholmgren)
or open an issue on GitHub. Opening an issue is usually the best and we respond to those pretty quickly.

# Contributing

I'm very open to ideas. Tweet me with your ideas or open a ticket (I don't mind!)
and let's discuss. **It's a good idea to run your idea by the committers before creating
a pull request.** We'll always consider your ideas carefully but not all ideas will be
incorporated.

## Working on New Features

1. Clone the repos into `Your-Project/Vendor/ProMotion`
2. Update your `Gemfile`to reference the project as `gem 'ProMotion', :path => "vendor/ProMotion/"`
3. Run `bundle`
4. Run `rake clean` and then `rake`
5. Contribute!

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the project
2. Create a feature branch
3. Code
4. Update or create new specs ** NOTE: your PR is far more likely to be merged if you include comprehensive tests! **
5. Make sure tests are passing by running `rake spec` *(you can run functional and unit specs separately with `rake spec:functional` and `rake spec:unit`)*
6. Submit pull request
7. Make a million little nitpicky changes that @jamonholmgren wants
8. Merged, then fame, adoration, kudos everywhere
